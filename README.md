# Octicons Push

The [Octicons Push](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/825432045044458754/Octicons-Push) Figma plugin makes it easy to contribute to [Octicons](https://primer.style/octicons), GitHub's open-source icon set. With this plugin, you can commit and push icons to the [Octicons](https://github.com/primer/octicons) repo directly from Figma, without ever touching a terminal.

ðŸ‘‰ [Install on Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/825432045044458754/Octicons-Push)

Here's how it works:
1. Select the icon frames you want to commit.
2. Open the plugin.
3. Select the branch you want to commit to. You can choose an existing branch or create a new branch.
4. Press "Commit." The plugin will then export, commit, and push the selected icons to the branch you chose. If you chose to create a new branch, the plugin will give you a link to where you can start a new pull request with your branch.
